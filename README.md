**c_game: an exercise in minimalism**

- c_game was created as a personal challenge: to build a renderer/game with as few external libraries as possible
- As of the writing of this README, c_game only depends on the C standard lib, OS libraries and the Vulkan SDK
- While the work has been slow-going, it's one of the projects I keep going back to and it has been quite useful as a learning tool.
- A great idea or an exercise in futility, you decide!
